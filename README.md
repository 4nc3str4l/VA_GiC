Getting pre-trained cnn
------

Our pre-trained caffemodel might be downloaded from, by iterations number:

* 5000: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8mcnj8j5hhytn6z/bsaor_iter_5000.caffemodel?dl=0
* 10000: https://www.dropbox.com/s/yw5535ckknlo17d/bsaor_iter_10000.caffemodel?dl=0
* 15000: https://www.dropbox.com/s/g5gh7lmab31d0x5/bsaor_iter_15000.caffemodel?dl=0
* 20000: https://www.dropbox.com/s/vuxo1ayux971z84/bsaor_iter_20000.caffemodel?dl=0 
* 25000: https://www.dropbox.com/s/y81588ziy4iglyj/bsaor_iter_25000.caffemodel?dl=0

And be freely used. We would, however, appreciate being cited, as does caffe.

Requierements
------

You must have python (2.7 is strongly recommended, might work on 3.0), alongside with latest OpenCV distribution for python, numpy and Caffe.

Installing Anaconda Python might be the fastest way to obtain all python related requierements. OpenCV might be installed by issuing:
> conda install binstar
>
> binstar search opencv
>
> binstar show menpo/opencv
>
>conda install --channel https://conda.binstar.org/menpo opencv
